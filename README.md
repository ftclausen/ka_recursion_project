# What is this?

This is my Khan Academy homework repo.

# Git Branches

The Processing JS set-up on Khan Academy does not quite use coordinates in the
same way as "vanilla" Processing JS so I've made a
`khan_academy_submission_version` branch of this project that will work on the
KA version of Processing JS.

## Recursion

The recursion homework references
[L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) so I thought it a fun
challenge to implement some examples from the Wikipedia page myself.

### Set up

Pop this repo on a web accessible location somewhere and navigate to the html
version of each project. E.g.

* Plant - http://example.com/khan_academy_homework/plant.html using plant.js
* Pythagoras Tree - http://example.com/khan_academy_homework/pythagoras_tree.html using pythagoras_tree.js

See below for examples
